  heading: "Gender equality workshops"
  text: "fEMPOWER runs workshops on how to recognise and challenge gender inequality. Our workshops cover a range of material but centre on the harmful effects of gender stereotypes. In particular, how they are linked to violence against women, participation in the workplace and societal expectations more broadly. We pride ourselves on tailoring our workshops to the needs of different schools and have run various workshops in public, private, comprehensive, single sex and selective schools."

  heading: "Host a workshop"
  text: "fEMPOWER is based in Sydney and Melbourne but operates throughout NSW and Victoria. We are happy to run workshops at all schools, but have a particular interest in schools in low socio-economic areas and those with culturally and linguistically diverse students. Our workshop facilitators are volunteers, but we request a compulsory donation from schools to cover our costs."

  heading: Get involved
  text: "Our organisationâ€™s work is reliant on the contributions of our wonderful volunteers. Volunteers must attend a training session before they can facilitate a workshop. We take volunteers of all genders and ages. Volunteering with us is a relatively flexible commitment as we allow you to opt in or out of workshop opportunities as they arise."

  text: "We started as a grassroots organisation operated out of the University of Sydney. Since then, it is the consistent support of community members that has allowed us to expand our program and deliver workshops at more disadvantaged schools in NSW. Donations help us with travel costs, hosting our volunteer training and creating workshop material."
