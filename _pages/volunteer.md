fEMPOWER is an entirely volunteer run organisation, so there are lots of ways you can get involved! 

As a volunteeer, you can choose to: 

* attend and present our workshops to high school students, helping to facilitate discussion and challenge their perspectives on gender, consent and violence,

and/or

* help behind the scenes by being a member of our organisational working groups. These six working groups - administration, fundraising, social media, content, volunteer engagement and data - meet on weekends or evenings, and are a great way for volunteers who work full time or hate the thought of returning to high school to get involved!

First things first though, you’ll need to attend a fEMPOWER training session. 

At fEMPOWER training we run through an introduction to gender theory and intersectional feminism, get you familiar with the content and activities presented to school students, and discuss some effective facilitation skills and tools. It’s a great day (with free lunch!) spent chatting about feminism and meeting amazing, like-minded people. 

*Our next fEMPOWER training for Sydney volunteers will be held on Sunday 31 March from 10am–4pm.*
