fEMPOWER is based in Sydneyâ€™s Inner West but operates throughout NSW. We are happy to run workshops at all schools, but have a particular interest in schools in low-socioeconomic areas and those with culturally and linguistically diverse students. Our workshop facilitators are volunteers, but we request a compulsory donation from schools to cover our costs.

For more information about hosting a workshop at your school, fill in the below form and we'll be in touch.
